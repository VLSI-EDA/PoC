Who uses PoC?
#############

PoC has a related Git repository called `PoC-Examples <https://github.com/VLSI-EDA/PoC-Examples>`_
on GitHub. This repository hosts a list of example and reference implementations
of the PoC-Library. Additional to reading an IP cores documention and viewing
its characteristic stimulus waveform in a simulation, it can helper to
investigate an IP core usage example from that repository.

* `Reconfigurable Cloud Computing Framework (RC2F) <https://github.com/VLSI-EDA/RC2F>`_ |br|
  An FPGA computing framework for virtualization and cloud integration.

* `PicoBlaze-Library <https://github.com/Paebbels/PicoBlaze-Library>`_ |br|
  The PicoBlaze-Library offers several PicoBlaze devices and code routines to
  extend a common PicoBlaze environment to a little System on a Chip (SoC or SoFPGA).

* `PicoBlaze-Examples <https://github.com/Paebbels/PicoBlaze-Examples>`_ |br|
  A SoFPGA reference implementation, based on the PoC-Library and the PicoBlaze-Library.
